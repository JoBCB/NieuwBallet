# NieuwBallet

an extension for [CodeKlavier](https://codeklavier.space/): Live coding with the piano as interface.

[Joana Chicau](http://www.joanachicau.com/) creates hybrid scores-scripts that link choreographic concepts with web-programming functions. For the collaboration with CodeKlavier she has developed a vocabulary of code based on classic ballet â€” with a twist.

The Nieuw Ballet is an audio-visual journey through web environments and information displays that brings new meaning and produces a new imaginary around the acts of coding. 

By connecting the piano keyboard with the web console on the browser, CodeKlavier will be triggering, juxtaposing and manipulating web actions, performing a myriad of interactions in the computer screen for the audience to follow.
