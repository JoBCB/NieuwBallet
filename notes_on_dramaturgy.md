### Igor Stravinsky - The Rite of Spring (1913)

> “One day [in 1910], when I was finishing the last pages of L'Oiseau de Feu in St Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision ... I saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps". — Stravinsky

> “1914, Stravinsky described The Rite of Spring as "a musical-choreographic work, [representing] pagan Russia ... unified by a single idea: the mystery and great surge of the creative power of Spring". In his analysis of The Rite, Pieter van den Toorn writes that the work lacks a specific plot or narrative, and should be considered as a succession of choreographed episodes.”

> “Butoh maybe a trigger to revolution (the Russian revolution did not begin with Lenin but with Nijinsky)” - MastsumiNeiro

__Structure:__

* Part I: L'Adoration de la Terre (Adoration of the Earth);
* Part II: Le Sacrifice (The Sacrifice);
* Mood board: low music and voice over; abrupt; angular; savage; visceral; earthy; dramatic; mystic;

> “The demonstrations, he says, grew into "a terrific uproar" which, along with the on-stage noises, drowned out the voice of Nijinsky who was shouting the step numbers to the dancers.” … “But music historian Richard Taruskin asserts, "it was not Stravinsky's music that did the shocking. It was the ugly earthbound lurching and stomping devised by Vaslav Nijinsky."”
